    <h2>Why Offensive Security</h2>

    <p>
      Traditional security controls often fail silently. Offensive security
      testing provides clarity by validating whether defenses work under
      realistic conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our assessments are designed to support informed decision-making by
      translating technical findings into business-relevant risk context.
