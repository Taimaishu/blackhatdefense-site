    <p>
      Black Hat Defense LLC provides authorized offensive security services
      designed to help organizations understand, validate, and reduce
      real-world security risk. All engagements are conducted under explicit
      authorization, with clearly defined scope and objectives.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our work emphasizes realistic attack scenarios, measurable impact,
      and practical remediation guidance that supports informed decision-making.

    <h2>Penetration Testing</h2>

    <p>
      Penetration testing simulates real-world attacks against applications,
      networks, and systems to identify exploitable weaknesses.
    </p>

    <p>
      This service helps organizations:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Validate the effectiveness of existing security controls</li>
      <li>Identify vulnerabilities with real impact</li>
      <li>Prioritize remediation based on actual risk</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Deliverables include a detailed report outlining findings, impact,
      and recommended remediation steps.
    </p>

    <h2>Adversarial Security Testing</h2>

    <p>
      Adversarial security testing evaluates how an organization would be
      affected by a motivated attacker operating under realistic constraints.
    </p>

    <p>
      This approach is used to assess:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Viable attack paths and chaining opportunities</li>
      <li>Gaps in detection and response capabilities</li>
      <li>Potential operational or business impact</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Testing is performed in a controlled, authorized manner and aligned
      to client objectives.
    </p>

    <h2>Network & Infrastructure Security Assessments</h2>

    <p>
      Network and infrastructure security assessments evaluate exposure
      across internal and external environments, including access controls,
      segmentation, and configuration weaknesses.
    </p>

    <p>
      These assessments are commonly used to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Understand external attack surface exposure</li>
      <li>Review internal trust boundaries</li>
      <li>Identify misconfigurations and high-risk access paths</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>ICS / SCADA Security Assessments</h2>

    <p>
      ICS and SCADA security assessments focus on identifying security
      weaknesses in operational technology environments where availability
      and safety are critical.
    </p>

    <p>
      Engagements are designed to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Minimize operational risk</li>
      <li>Respect uptime and safety constraints</li>
      <li>Identify exposure at the network, protocol, and configuration level</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Testing is carefully planned and coordinated with relevant stakeholders.
    </p>

    <h2>OSINT & Attack Surface Mapping</h2>

    <p>
      OSINT-driven attack surface mapping identifies publicly accessible
      information and assets that could be leveraged by an attacker.
    </p>

    <p>
      This includes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Internet-facing systems and services</li>
      <li>Exposed credentials or sensitive metadata</li>
      <li>Organizational exposure across third-party platforms</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The goal is to reduce unintended visibility and external risk.
    </p>
